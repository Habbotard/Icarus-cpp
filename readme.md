## Icarus

Icarus is a Habbo Hotel private server written in C++ designed for version *PRODUCTION-201512012203-525044429*. There is **no Linux version available**, the only supported operating system is Windows.

This should compile out of the box if you open up *Icarus.vcxproj* with Visual Studio 2015 C++

## Installation

1. None.

## Compile

*For Windows Server 2012 / Windows 10 (it's not my problem if you're still using Windows Server 2008 in 2016)*

**Required:**

- A modern Windows operating system

**Compiling steps**

- Install [Visual Studio Community](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978&clcid=0x409);

- Make sure you're installing C++ components

- Open up Icarus.vcxproj

If you see files look like this (how there's no folders etc):

Click the second "Icarus" down from the top and select "show all files" and it will look like this:

Because I like my files being seperated into actual meaningful folders instead of some filters.
